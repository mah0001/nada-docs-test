NADA documentation
================================

NADA is an open source microdata cataloging system, complaint with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and Dublin Core's RDF metadata standards. It serves as a portal for researchers to browse, search, compare, apply for access, and download relevant census or survey datasets, questionnaires, reports and other information.
